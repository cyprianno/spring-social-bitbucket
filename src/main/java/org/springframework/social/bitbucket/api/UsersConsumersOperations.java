/**
 * A consumer is an application authorized to integrate with a Bitbucket account.
 * Account owners or team administrators can give third-party web applications access to a Bitbucket individual account or a team.
 * By integrating an application with Bitbucket, you authorize that account to act as your user.
 * So, for example, if you have read/write access to all of the account, the application does as well.
 * Anything you could do when logged into Bitbucket, that application can also do.
