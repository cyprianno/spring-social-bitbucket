/**
 * Bitbucket integrates with external services (hooks) through a set of brokers that run in response to certain events.
 * Brokers are Python scripts that receive information about an event and then take one or more actions.
 * For example, there is a Bamboo broker for integrating with Bamboo.
 * The Bitbucket team developed many of our brokers. Third-party vendors also developed several brokers.
 * The Bitbucket services resource provides functionality for adding, removing, and configuring brokers on your repositories.
 * All the methods on this resource require the caller to authenticate.
